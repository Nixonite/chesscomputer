chesscomputer
=============

Research project from the Playful Systems group at the MIT Media Lab to augment the chess viewing experience. A collaboration with grandmaster Maurice Ashley.

## Boomerang Search

Python Scripts to automate the Stockfish chess engine to detect "boomerang positions": positions where one side has what seems like a strong move, but turns out many moves down to have catastrophic results.

## Commentary Interface

A web-based interface designed to be used on-screen while commenting on a chess match. Current features include:

* Madden Mode: draw on top of the chess board
* Controlled-squares visualization
* Piece class hiding
* Drag-and-drop move interface
* Integration with the Boomerang Search interface described above for the computer's next move predictions and client-side boomerang detection.
